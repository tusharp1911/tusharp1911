Hello All, I am Tushar Patil, a DevOps Engineer with over 7.6 years of hands-on experience in designing, automating, and optimizing cloud infrastructures across AWS, Azure, Oracle Cloud (OCI), and Akamai Linode.

I specialize in CI/CD automation, containerization, and infrastructure as code (IaC) using tools like Terraform and Ansible, ensuring consistent, reliable, and scalable deployments across environments.

Over the years, I‚Äôve implemented robust monitoring and observability systems using Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, AWS CloudWatch, and Azure Monitor, helping teams achieve faster incident resolution and a 40% reduction in MTTR.

Security is at the heart of my work ‚Äî I integrate DevSecOps practices into pipelines using SonarQube, Trivy, OWASP ZAP, and Azure Key Vault, ensuring every deployment is both secure and compliant.

I also bring experience in database management (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, MSSQL) and data engineering tools like Apache Kafka and Apache Spark, building production-ready data platforms and analytics systems.

Recognized with multiple Bravo Awards for excellence in automation, documentation, and innovation, I‚Äôm passionate about continuous learning, mentoring, and driving efficiency across teams.

I currently hold the AWS Certified Solutions Architect ‚Äì Associate (SAA-C03) certification and am based in Pune, Maharashtra.
